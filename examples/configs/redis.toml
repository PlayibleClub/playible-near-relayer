# Redis config
# This is a config for a relayer that covers gas for user transactions up to a allowance specified in Redis to interact with a whitelisted set of contracts.
# Allowances are on a per account id basis and on signup (account creation in redis and on-chain) an oauth token is required to help with sybil resistance

# Please note this is for reference only and you should be updating the values in the `config.toml` file found in the `pagoda-relayer-rs` directory.

relayer_account_id = "nomnomnom.testnet"
# replace with json files containing 3 entries: account_id (should match relayer_account_id), public_key, private_key
# this is recommended for high throughput use cases to prevent nonce race conditions
